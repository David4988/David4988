## 📝 Notable Projects

### 🔹 Friendify - [friendify](https://friendify-phi.vercel.app)
A social media clone of Instagram called *Friendify*, developed using **ReactJS**, **Node.js**, and **Appload**. This project replicates core social media features, although it currently does not include chat or comment options. *Friendify* has helped me deepen my understanding of full-stack development and UI design.

### 🔹 Tech Haven
An e-commerce website created for an internship, where I led a team of absolute beginners in developing both front-end and back-end functionalities. This project has been an incredible learning journey in teamwork, problem-solving, and implementing complex web development tasks.

### 🔹 Innovators Hub Music - [innovators-hub-music](https://innovators-hub-music-1bc35.web.app/)
A full-featured music streaming web app built using ReactJS and Firebase. It includes user authentication, profile management, in-app music playback, and a protected admin dashboard to upload and manage albums and tracks. This project helped me sharpen my skills in frontend development, Firebase integration, and real-time data management.
